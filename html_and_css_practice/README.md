This project is intended to be a refresher for what I've learned so far in the course. I will go all the way up to the "Block and Inline" section in "CSS Foundations" and stop right before "Introduction to Flexbox".

Some goals for this project: 
-Use the Terminal to create and manipulate files and directories, as well as push progress to Github.
-Create a website with a homepage containing: links to multiple other pages, images, and stylized text.
    -Use external CSS along with some internal and inline CSS.
    -Incorporate elements and tags, lists, and selectors (class, ID).
