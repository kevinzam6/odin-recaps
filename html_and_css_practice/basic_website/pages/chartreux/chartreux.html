            The Chartreux is a sturdy, shorthaired French breed coveted in antiquity for its hunting 
            prowess and its dense, water repellent fur. This breed’s husky, robust type is sometimes 
            termed primitive, neither cobby nor classic. Though amply built, Chartreux are extremely 
            supple and agile cats; refined, never coarse nor clumsy.

            Chartreux are the strong silent types of the cat fancy; they keep their comments to 
            themselves, even when standing beside empty food dishes. Chartreux may open their mouths 
            as if to meow, but no sound comes out. When they do vocalize, it’s usually with small 
            chirps or trills—it’s amazing to hear tiny chirps come out of those large, powerful 
            bodies and strong jaws. They do purr with the greatest enthusiasm, however, particularly 
            when you’re serving up their favorite snack. In addition, quality time with their 
            preferred persons always make them smile. Nevertheless, Chartreux cats have a quiet but 
            well-developed sense of humor, and enjoy a good joke, particularly if it’s at your 
            expense.
