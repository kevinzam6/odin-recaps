            The toyger cat is a friendly, easygoing cat with an ideal temperament and 
            personality. Toygers make great additions to families with children or 
            pets and are ready to play and offer affection. If you're looking for a 
            below-average amount of commitment to exercising your cat, the toyger's 
            energy level may not be for you. Their intelligence makes them susceptible
            to boredom, so playtime is essential. Toygers are trainable and can be 
            taught to do tricks.

            Each cat's markings are distinct. Unlike the mackerel stripes or round 
            rosettes of a tabby, a toyger's fur pattern is random. The ideal toyger 
            head bears circular markings, which cannot be found on any other domestic 
            cat breed. Its short, uniquely patterned fur is non-hypoallergenic.

            The shape of a toyger's head in profile is described as a "half-hexagon." 
            Toyger cats are long, lean, and muscular but not bulky, with a long, thin tail 
            with a rounded tip. It has round small ears and bright green or blue eyes.
