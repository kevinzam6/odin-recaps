            The Tonkinese is a mix of the Siamese and Burmese cat breeds and shares 
            many qualities with those parents. This striking feline has a charming 
            appearance, with a pointed coat and bright, jewel-tone eyes.

            Attentive Tonks were born to be a companion breed. These kitties love to 
            play with people and curl up in a warm lap at the end of the day. They 
            have a lot of affection to give their pet parents and make a wonderful, 
            loving addition to many homes and families.

            Tonks have a personality fit for companionship. Cold and aloof? Not these 
            cats! These sweet kitties love their role as lap cat and always have 
            affection to share with their family. The Tonkinese shares his curiosity 
            and intelligence with his Siamese side and affectionate energy with his 
            Burmese ancestors.

            Tonks are playful, smart, and social pets who enjoy spending time with 
            their pet parents and supervising day-to-day life. This breed is 
            incredibly talkative, and they expect you to listenâ€”and respond! Some 
            might call this take-charge breed a little bit bossy, but your Tonk's 
            heart is usually in the right place.

            These fantastic felines are intelligent and inventive. The Tonkinese is 
            like his Siamese ancestors in his desire to master interactive toys and 
            try new tricks. Tonks are active, silly cats with a reputation for jumping
            high and clowning around to entertain their family.
